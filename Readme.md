# FSS Documentation

Creating, managing and runnig FSS application manual.

## Project Creation

Project FSS was created following next commands:
`sencha -sdk path/to/extjs/framework generate app FSS path/to/project/folder --modern`. This step will generate basic ExtJS application

Adding cordova support via `sencha cordova init com.emisia.fss FSS`. This step will add support for cordova project so that we can build mobile application. 
By doing this the `app.json` file is updated to add platform support, this config is added to build profiles:
	
		"android": {
               "packager": "cordova",
               "cordova": {
               "config": {
                      "platforms": "android",
                      "id": "com.emisia.fss",
                      "name": "FSS"
               }
           },
           "toolkit": "modern",
           "theme": "theme-material"
        }

If cordova is not install, please install cordova via npm: `sudo npm install -g cordova`

## Adding a theme

To a theme run next command: `sencha generate theme my-theme`. This will add a new folder named my-theme in packages/local folder.


## Firebase support

Firebase is Google solution for Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications) also called GCM. We have added cordova plugin for firebase messaging
`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-firebase --save`

## Build & Run

There are three commands available to build and run ExtJS cordova application:
 - Building application is done via command: `sencha app build PROFILE`
 - Watch application is done via: `sencha app watch PROFILE`
 - To run application on emulator or android device: `sencha app run PROFILE`
    
If you want to run application on an emulator, you need to create AVD emulator with name `android` and if your phone is connected to a PC then it will default to your device.


## Debugging

Debugging web application is as always done via Developer tools. Debugging android devices is also done via Developer tools by navigating to `chrome://inspect/#devices` 
and choosing your device from the list of attached devices. Note that both devices and emulators will be listed and both can be inspected. 
Debugging devices will have to activate USB Debugging option located under Developer options, which can be activated if you tap 7 times on the Build number.


## Checkout / Clone project
